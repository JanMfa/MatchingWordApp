A large text file (allwords.txt) contains a single word on each line in alphabetic order, for every value match the substrings on each line given by commonwords.txt. The program (MatchingWordsApp.exe) will then output a text file (matchingwords.txt)


## HOW TO compile:

1. Put all the downloaded files in the same path/folder.
1. Create a new C++ Project. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/walkthrough-creating-a-standard-cpp-program-cpp?view=vs-2019)
1. Put MatchingWordApp.cpp under Source Files.
1. Put the other text files under Resources Files.
1. Build your solution (Build > Build Solution), and make sure there is no error generated.
1. Run the solution. (Debug > Start Debugging)
1. Output of matchingwords.txt is generated.
